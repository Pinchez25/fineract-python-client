    Apache Fineract REST API

    Apache Fineract is a secure, multi-tenanted microfinance platform. The goal of the Apache Fineract API is to empower developers to build apps on top of the Apache Fineract Platform. The https://cui.fineract.dev[reference app] (username: mifos, password: password) works on the same demo tenant as the interactive links in this documentation. Until we complete the new REST API documentation you still have the legacy documentation available https://fineract.apache.org/legacy-docs/apiLive.htm[here]. Please check https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current[the Fineract documentation] for more information.
